# Homework 2: Create a Dashboard

Due Date: 12/2

Creating multiple types of visuals from the same data is an important way to convey information to application users. Students will create a Dashboard using a static download of an Open Data or a Dataset from their own place of employment (make sure you have permission to use it for this assignment first!) 

Students may make their application in either flexdashboard or shinydashboard layouts. The final dashboard should be working and deployed onto shinyapps.io.

Directions:

* Include at least:
    * Three (3) input/filters
    * Three (3) single numeric based boxes/gauges
    * One (1) datatable
    * Three (3) interactive and reactively responsive charts. 
      * These elements should be places throughout a dashboard with at least three (3) pages or tabs with an analytical themes or question about the data. 
  * On the server side your plots and tables must utilize the reactive function for any and all datasets.
* Your final app must work when deployed to shinyapps.io.
